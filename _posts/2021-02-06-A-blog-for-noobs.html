<p>The section will cover a high overview of Information Technology (IT) split into 3 different categories and where Security fits best.</p>

<h3 id="orderedlist">The three differentiating categories within IT are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Hardware </li>
<li>Software </li>
<li>User </li>
</ol>




<p>Although a lot of future blog post will cover things in the Software and User Domain, itâ€™s good to know how these categories fit together.</p>
